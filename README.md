# ChoronoFlow

This repo is a final group project completed as part of the [Dev Academy Aotearoa](https://devacademy.co.nz/) curriculum. This single page application (SPA) gives a chronological indicator of major historical inventions, events and people. It was built using React, TypeScript, Express, Node, Vitest, Knex and Sqlite3. I worked on testing and the majority of the frontend components and styling with Tailwind.
