# Conflict Resolution Plan

How/when will you give each other feedback during the project?

Mini retro after each sprint
Feedback within pairs as you're going - as soon as possible.
Not calling out in public. - Growth feedback should be 1 on 1
Always ask if the person is in the right space to recieve growth feedback.
Directly ask if you would like to recieve feedback from the team.


How will you make decisions together?

Votes - usually within standups.
Group consensus always before moving forward.
Would prefer everyone to be present when big decisions get made.
Product owner gets vito??


How will you ensure that everyone in your team has an opportunity to feel included and contribute effectively?

Check-in contribution wise in standups - like if they feel like they're contributing too much or too little. We can adjust as neccessary to accommodate.
Even distribution of tickets.

What routines will you put in place to ensure consistent communication between team members?



When will you schedule breaks?

We have scheduled the lunch breaks to be the same as the breaks we're used to,
si Tuesday and Thursday will still be longer breaks as usual, but we will check-in to see if people would like to work during breaks.


What days will you work, and what days will you take a break?

We have made a list of everyones availabilities as it stands on day one, 
and also added that there is no pressure to work outside of the school hours or on weekends.
We again have left this to be quite flexible depending on other commitments and changing timlines for the projetc.

How will you use Non Violent Communication (NVC) techniques? If so, please outline what these are.


How will you incorporate regular (wellbeing) check ins? When and how will you do this?


How will you share your wellbeing needs with each other?
